# Predict-Machine-Failure-Using-Sensor-Data

A water supply company faced a serious machine failure problem. To help the company to predict the machine failure using sensor data, I built a long short term memory model (LSTM). The model can predict the machine failure at least 5 mins in advance. The model makes 277 alarms within the window of 12h ahead of the failure, which is enough to inform the engineers to check whether there is a problem.
